# predicting-nfl-mvp

This is my data science project in which I aim to predict the winner of the 2022 AP NFL MVP award. I have completed
the web-scraping process of the project, having scraped necessary data from websites to HTML, and finally into a CSV file.
I have also completed the data cleaning portion of this project, in which I have filled any holes or gaps in the data as well
as properly restructuring the data for the machine learning model to create correlations.

The "mvp" and "passing" folders hold HTML files originating from my web-scraping of pro-football-reference.com.
