# predicting-nfl-mvp

This is my data science project in which I aim to predict the winner of the 2022 AP NFL MVP award. So far, I have completed
the web-scraping process of the project, having scraped necessary data from websites to HTML, and finally into a CSV file.
More documentation of this project is coming soon.
