# predicting-nfl-mvp

This is my data science project in which I aim to predict the winner of the 2022 AP NFL MVP award. So far, I have completed
the web-scraping process of the project, having scraped necessary data from websites to HTML, and finally into a CSV file.
More documentation of this project is coming soon.

The "mvps" folder holds HTML files originating from my web-scraping of pro-football-reference.com.

Here is the link to my project documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GoMXg79rptqx1lZ2xviSXdt573SkwqaxPlVbwhR6zMs/edit?usp=sharing
