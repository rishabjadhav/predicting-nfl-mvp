# predicting-nfl-mvp

This is my data science project in which I attempted to predict the winner of the 2023 AP NFL MVP award. I completed
an end to end web-scraping process to collect usable data, and parsing it into a CSV file.
I have also completed the data cleaning portion of this project, in which I have filled any holes or gaps in the data as well
as properly restructuring the data for the machine learning model to create correlations.

The "mvp", "passing", and "rushing" folders hold HTML files originating from my web-scraping of pro-football-reference.com.
